A [repository](https://github.com/BachoSeven/eti) for the course of **Elementi di Teoria degli Insiemi** held by Marcello Mamino in 2022, containing:

- a simple [list](https://github.com/BachoSeven/eti/raw/build/lista.pdf) of theorems, inspired from
[baldo](https://poisson.phc.dm.unipi.it/~baldino)'s lists.
- a simple [proof](https://github.com/BachoSeven/eti/raw/build/könig.pdf) of König's theorem.
